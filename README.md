Currently my main project is **xCore**. This project was initially started by @LeandroSSJ, however he has started many other projects.

What is **xCore**? This is a essentials core that offers many features that most servers need, or really want and end up paying Developers to add these features. Well, I did this all for free!

**xCore** can be fully configured, and all **Listeners** and **Commands** can be toggled off, which is what makes this core very unique.
